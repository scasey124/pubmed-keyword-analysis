Streamlit Pubmed Keyword Analysis Application


Use of Pubmed API (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/developers/) and PyMed python library (https://github.com/gijswobben/pymed).

Users input a keyword, which is then used to retrieve the most recent publicly available articles from PubMed. The retrieved articles are organized into a dataframe, which users can download as a CSV file. The project also includes a keyword co-occurrence analysis to identify similarities between articles. This analysis produces both a visual representation and a downloadable CSV file of the findings. The output provides users with a quick overview of the topics currently associated with their keyword of interest, thereby aiding their research and saving valuable time.
